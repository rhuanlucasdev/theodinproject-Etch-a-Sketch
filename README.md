# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is a simple web-based drawing tool built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum. This project challenges you to create an interactive "sketchpad" that allows users to draw with their mouse, similar to the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. The main goal of this project is to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with JavaScript to dynamically update the UI.

- Draw with your mouse on a grid of customizable size.
- Reset the drawing grid with a button.
- Customize the grid's dimensions and styles.
- Responsive design for use across devices.

## Built With
